# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

By default, only the latest tagged version is supported.

In case of major issues upgrading to the latest tag, a backport
to a previous release from the same major version can be considered.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please open a standard issue and mention `Vulnerability:` in the title.

Depending on the severity, it will be reviewed as part of the
next development cycle.
