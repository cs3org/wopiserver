# WOPI Server

This service is part of the ScienceMesh Interoperability Platform (IOP) and implements a vendor-neutral application gateway compatible with the Web-application Open Platform Interface ([WOPI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/cloud-storage-partner-program/online)) specifications.

It enables ScienceMesh EFSS storages to integrate Office Online platforms including Microsoft Office Online and Collabora Online. In addition it implements a [bridge](src/bridge/readme.md) module with dedicated extensions to support apps like CodiMD and Etherpad.

## Modules

* [core](src/core/readme.md)
* [bridge](src/bridge/readme.md)

## Changelog

[Available here](CHANGELOG.md)

## Compatibility

This WOPI server implements the required APIs to ensure full compatibility with Collabora Online and Microsoft Office. For the latter, however, the OneNote application uses newer WOPI APIs and is currently not supported.

## Unit testing

The `/test` folder contains some unit tests for the supported storage interfaces.
No tests are provided (yet) for the core WOPI server, though the test suite aims at covering all
storage access patterns used by the WOPI server.

By default, the local storage is tested, and the CI runs it as well (_TODO_ test against Reva in the CI).
To run the tests, either run `pytest` if available in your system, or execute the following:

1. Run all tests: `python3 test/test_storageiface.py [-v]`
2. Run only one test: `python3 test/test_storageiface.py [-v] TestStorage.<the test you would like to run>`

### Test against a Reva endpoint:

1. Clone reva (https://github.com/cs3org/reva)
2. Run Reva according to <https://reva.link/docs/tutorials/share-tutorial/> (ie up until step 4 in the instructions).
3. Run the tests: `WOPI_STORAGE=cs3 python3 test/test_storageiface.py`

### Test against an Eos endpoint:

1. Make sure your Eos instance is configured to accept connections from WOPI as a privileged gateway
2. Configure `wopiserver-test.conf` according to your Eos setup. The provided defaults are valid at CERN.
3. Run the tests: `WOPI_STORAGE=xroot python3 test/test_storageiface.py`


## Test the `open` workflow with Reva

_Note: this test workflow is now deprecated and the Reva CLI should be used instead._

1. Run Reva as detailed above
2. Login with `reva login`
3. Extract (from the logs) your `x-access-token`
4. Upload an ODF or .md file with the reva CLI (or copy it to Reva's storage, e.g. in `/var/tmp/reva/data/einstein`)
5. From the wopiserver container, execute `wopiopen.py -v READ_WRITE /<your_file.odt> <your_x-access-token>`
6. If the above call is successful, you are given the URL of the application provider, with appropriate parameters (including a WOPI access token) to open your file: open it in a browser to start your edit session via WOPI

For testing collaborative scenarios, repeat the above for each user participating in the collaborative session. Reusing the `x-access-token` is OK, however it is generally not OK to open multiple times the same application provider URL, and different WOPI access tokens are needed instead.


## Run the WOPI server locally for development purposes

1. Install all requirements listed in `requirements.txt`
2. Add log file directory: `sudo mkdir /var/log/wopi/ && sudo chmod a+rwx /var/log/wopi`
3. Create the folder for the wopi config: `sudo mkdir /etc/wopi/ && sudo chmod a+rwx /etc/wopi`
4. Create the files `iopsecret` and `wopiscret` in the folder `/etc/wopi/`, create random strings for the secrets
5. Copy the provided `wopiserver.conf` to `/etc/wopi/wopiserver.defaults.conf`
6. Create a config file `/etc/wopi/wopiserver.conf`: start from `docker/etc/wopiserver.conf` for a minimal configuration and add from the defaults file as needed
7. From the WOPI server folder run: `python3 src/wopiserver.py`
